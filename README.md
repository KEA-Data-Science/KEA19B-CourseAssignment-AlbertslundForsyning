# KEA19B-CourseAssignment-AlbertslundForsyning
Assignment aimed at reproducing a subset of Danish power provider Albertslund Forsyning's website utilizing the Spring Framework. Nothing creative to see here.


# This is an educational project with no creative merits.

<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
A reproduction of three scraped pages from Albertslund Electricity Provider;
the task was to create a select 3-page subset of the full website, potentially recreating
server-involving activity using the Spring Framework, Thymeleaf and other web technologies.
<p></p><p>
A proper introduction to the project in regards to the context and planning of the project,
 is found on the landing page of the functional project (- ideally, I haven't added the content yet,
 but a man can dream).</p>
